What we've covered in lesson 2:
In lesson 2 we learned about many different ways to calculate pi for a circle. We also learned about boolean and accumulators.

Can you get a better answer more quickly using a larger circle?
It does not matter whether you use a larger circle or not. The answer will be found at the same rate.
